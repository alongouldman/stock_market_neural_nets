    "\n",
    "Our goal is to predict stocks' future prices, using historical prices data.  \n",
    "But not stock prices alone would be interesting to forecast;  \n",
    "prediction of stock's volatility, or future direction (up/down) - would be interesting, and might yeild profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would want to be able to predict stocks's prices, and beat the ultimate benchmark - the market itself.  \n",
    "That being said, beating the market isnt necessarily an indication of good strategy, as there might be other strategies that beat our strategy.  \n",
    "Therefore, assuming we do manage to beat the market, we would make a comparison between our model/s, and other models/trading strategies."

    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind being able to predict the prices of the stock market is clear -  \n",
    "knowing if price of a stock would go up, would allow us as investors to trade the stocks and earn profits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This simple goal is, in fact, one of the toughest problems in history.  \n",
    "Great minds and a lot of money was spilled trying to solve this problem -  \n",
    "since this ability to forecast prices means a great financial benefit for the one who acquire it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The equty market is a zero-sum game - one's gains is another's losses.  \n",
    "Therefore, market participents has no interest of sharing knowledge,  \n",
    "as once someone does, the knowledge will be \"priced\" in the market, and the edge will be lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic nature of the stock market - the changing correlations and non-linearity -  \n",
    "make some researches believe in the \"randon walk theory\" - which state that stock prices move randomly.  \n",
    "Even if the stock market is not totally random, it is affected by many factors, such as global\n",
    "economy, politics, investor expectation, etc -  \n",
    "which make future movements very hard to forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said - we try our luck in solving this problem. We believe we have a chance to success, because of these factors: \n",
    "1. The data about the stocks is out there - but turns out it is not so easy to put your hands on good quality data after all.  \n",
    "We had a hard time getting big amount of data (more on that later),  \n",
    "so we think that when raising the entry barrier up - we face less competitors. \n",
    "2. We assume that even if the data looks random - it is not random at all.  \n",
    "The price of a stock is an aggregated mix of what every investor in the world is pricing that stock in that moment.  \n",
    "Humans are not so rational - but they do not act randomly.  \n",
    "And so, it make sense to us that there could be a way to predict the way people will behave."

    "### Adding more data\n",
    "We currantly only tested our models against Apple inc.'s data.  \n",

    "1. We have a lot of data - and we are limited in computetion power.  \n",
    "We might reach the limits of our private CPU's power, and this can hold us back.\n",
    "2. If the stock's prices alone can't tell us about what the future is holding -  \n",
